              {% comment %}|add:post.image  UFC 311 was more than combat; it was a meditation on struggle and triumph. Islam Makhachev defended his title with a first-round submission,
               proving his mastery once more...<!--Merab Dvalishvili outlasted Umar Nurmagomedov, etching his name deeper into the anals of  bantamweight history. 
               Jiri Prochazka, fueled by a fevered binge of martial arts films, dismantled Jamahal Hill in a cinematic display of technique and heart.
               Each bout was a verse in the poetry of human resilienceâ€”a reminder that beyond the blood and sweat, the octagon is where warriors seek not just victory,
                but transcendence.-->
